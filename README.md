# BlairEdreira.com

## About
Welcome to my personal site. The goal I had in mind when creating BlairEdreira.com was one of interest and captivity. I wanted to pull the visitor in with an interesting, animated front page and only grasp more of their attention as they scrolling down the page. Animations do a great job when it comes to grabbing the user’s attention. Fluidity is something I try to incorporate in any project I’m working on whether it be a web site or an application. Everything should have a transition as well as smooth entrances and exits. I built this website from scratch with no templates. You might ask why but I felt like my development career should include at least one project where I started with a blank page and ended up with a fully functional website. This site acts as my portfolio and its sole purpose is to let other know what I can do. 

## The Tools

Although I built this site without any templates I did use some interesting tools to get the effects and annimations I wanted. Check out the roles each tool played below:
